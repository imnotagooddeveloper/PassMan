* Encode again on every add and remove action to make your cpu cook itself!
* Instead of any secure way use raw text data as data inside your home folder ( Windows: "C:\Users\YourUsr\passwd\data.txt" Linux: "~\Passwd\data.txt"
* %1000 Safe data transfer! (its not BUT! encoded data gets transfered so even if anyone catches it he wont be able to read unless your data is so smoll and password is weak)
